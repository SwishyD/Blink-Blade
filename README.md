NOTE: When playing the game in-editor, playing any scene other than MainMenu may cause red errors due to certain DoNotDestroy objects not being present in other scenes.

Also: Levels 2-4 and 3-4 are blank due to time constraints - their scenes remain in the game's data so as not to disrupt database systems that had these hypothetical levels in mind.
